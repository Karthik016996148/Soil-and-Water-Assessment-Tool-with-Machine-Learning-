# swatML: Soil and Water Assessment Tool with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
The swatML project integrates machine learning techniques with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict soil drainage classes. Leveraging data from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and various climate data, this project aims to enhance soil-water dynamics understanding, improve resource management, and provide actionable insights for sustainable agriculture.

## Data Sources
- **Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD)**: Provides comprehensive soil data including properties and drainage classes.
- **NOAA Climate Data**: Offers temperature, precipitation, and other climatic parameters.
- **Local Geospatial Data**: Used for detailed regional analysis.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Main programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **R**: Used for statistical analysis and visualizations.
- **QGIS**: For geospatial data manipulation and mapping.
- **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management and storage.

## Models
- **Soil Drainage Prediction Model**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict soil drainage categories based on soil characteristics and climate factors.
- **Climate Impact Model**: Analyzes the impact of climatic changes on soil properties over time.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
